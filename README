About
---------------------------------------
This program is a designer for Celtic knotworks, using the algorithm described
at http://www.entrelacs.net/ .
It's mostly functional with some occasional crashes but far from complete.
Some UI elements have no effect as their underlaying actions have not been
implemented.
